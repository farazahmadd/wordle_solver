# Wordle
  Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Wordle is very simple to play, but harder to crack. The  deduction game requires the player to come up with a five-letter word. Players are given up to six guesses to complete the word and this word changes every day. Wordle got famous very quickly during the pandemic when people start spending more time online and quickly became an internet sensation. I discovered Wordle about four months ago and Iâ€™ve been playing it ever since and it has become part of my morning routine. I loved it so much that I challenged myself to create a Wordle-Solver. There were some python implementations available, so I decided to perform this task using MATLAB gui. My problem-solving skills came in very handy while performing this task.It took me almost two days to perform this task and it was a very fun and enriching learning experience.
